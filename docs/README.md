# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides an overview of OctoAcme's approach to project management and quick links to reference documentation for each process.

## Project Management Processes Summary

OctoAcme manages projects with a clear lifecycle: **Initiation**, **Planning**, **Execution & Tracking**, **Release & Deployment**, and **Close & Retrospective**. Our approach is built on five core principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback and learning

Core documentation covers roles, checklists, risk management, and retrospective practices—all centered on data-informed, cross-functional team collaboration.
